The implementation has a runtime of n^2 because if we have n elements, we first compare it to another element and then
we add it to the new double array. This means that each element has two operations performed on it which would be n^2.
This makes our mergeklists Big-O of n^2.

The implementation's space is Big-O of n because the result array that is output has the same number of elements as the
input array. Technically, our implementation's space is 4n because of the incrementing variables, but we ignore the
constants so it's just n.
